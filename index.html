  <h1>Dr Tom Phillips</h1>

  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>I am a data engineer interested in data warehousing, real-world data products and applied machine
    learning systems. Currently I'm Senior Data Engineer at <a href="https://oaknorth.co.uk/">Oaknorth Bank</a>.

  <p>Previously, I ran my own data science and engineering consultancy.
    Before that I led engineering at Octopus Energy's research lab, <a href="https://www.centrefornetzero.org/">Centre
      for Net Zero</a>.
    We <a href="https://github.com/centrefornetzero/domestic-heating-abm/">simulated over 9 million households</a> to
    find out whether the UK government will achieve its heat pump installation targets (it won't).

  <p>I have six years experience in startups.
    At Fluidly, I forecasted the cash flow of tens of thousands of small businesses. At DueDil, a company information
    platform, I worked for clients on bespoke data projects and entity resolution systems. Both have since been
    acquired.</p>

  <p>I have a PhD in Chemistry from Imperial College London, where I <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/64907">built
      chemical reactors to make high-quality nanoparticles for solar photovoltaics</a>.
    My work has <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8BSQ__QAAAAJ">over 450 citations</a>.
