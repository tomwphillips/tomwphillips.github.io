I am a data and software engineer with over a decade of experience working with data in scientific research and business, primarily finance.

I have a PhD in Chemistry from Imperial College London, where I [built chemical reactors to make high-quality nanoparticles for solar photovoltaics](http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/64907). You can find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8BSQ__QAAAAJ).

I live in West Yorkshire with my partner, two children and two cats. I grew up in the south of England and spent over a decade in London, and I wish I had moved north sooner.

All views here are my own and do not represent those of my employer, past or present.
